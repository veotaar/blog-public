# About

This blog is a three part project for testing my full-stack skills.

- Backend is a node/express project.
- I am using MongoDB with mongoose for the database.
- There are two frontends consuming the API, one is a public blog site (this one), other is a CMS with authentication / authorization for writing, editing, and deleting blog posts and comments.
